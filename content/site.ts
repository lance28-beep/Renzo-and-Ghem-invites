  narrative: `On February 5, 2015, destiny quietly began its work. Renzo saw Ghem in a Facebook
photo—smiling effortlessly with her high school friends. In that single moment, curiosity turned
into courage. He asked one of her friends for help, hoping for a simple introduction that would
change everything.
With a playful nudge from fate, her friend said, “Accept mo daw si Renzo Liwanag… ayan ha,
baka humabol pa kayo sa Valentine’s.”
And so, Ghem accepted the friend request.
What began as a simple click—an innocent “accept”—became the first chapter of a love story
written not just by chance, but by perfect timing. From that small digital moment grew
conversations, laughter, friendship, and a love strong enough to lead them here
today—standing hand in hand, choosing each other, forever.
Together, they discovered that love could be a partnership built on dreams. Even as students
starting with online selling, they stood side by side—planning, hustling, and believing in their
potential. They explored every venture their hearts dared to dream—buy and sell, boutique
businesses, cellphone trading, motor parts, and barbecue stalls—proving that shared vision
makes no dream too small and no goal too far. In every effort, they invested trust, patience,
and love, building not just businesses but a life together rooted in teamwork, resilience, and
growing love.
Like all true love stories, theirs faced trials. In 2021, challenges led to a season of distance,
where hearts were tested and paths uncertain. Yet, through patience, commitment, and
enduring faith, Renzo and Ghem found their way back to one another.
What was once shaken returned stronger,
deeper, and more certain than ever
before—a testament to love that
perseveres.
In 2023, after years of shared dedication
and hard work, they opened their own
minimart, turning dreams into reality and
demonstrating the power of love,
perseverance, and partnership.
With Ghem devoted to her career and
Renzo supporting their growing ventures,
they continue to walk side by side.
Today, they stand hand in hand, not only as
partners in life and business but as souls
who have chosen each other—today,
tomorrow, and always. `,
